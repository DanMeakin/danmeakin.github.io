Hi! I'm Dan, a Software Developer living in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I've spent the last three years working in startups and scaleups building products with customers firmly in mind. I advocate for writing code which solves the problems particular to your business, and for everything else using existing libraries, frameworks and tools written by people smarter than me. A lot of the time, this means loudly shouting about writing boring code and solving softer problems.

I'm also crazy about strongly-typed functional programming -- Haskell in particular -- and try to bring as many lessons into my day-to-day from here.
