            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>Hi! I’m Dan, a Software Developer living in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last three years working in startups and scaleups building products with customers firmly in mind. I advocate for writing code which solves the problems particular to your business, and for everything else using existing libraries, frameworks and tools written by people smarter than me. A lot of the time, this means loudly shouting about writing boring code and solving softer problems.</p>
<p>I’m also crazy about strongly-typed functional programming – Haskell in particular. As someone working generally in very small engineering organisations, I believe there are massive untapped benefits in using strong typing to improve reliability and decrease the maintenance burden of software. I can’t use Haskell in my workplace, but I can try to bring lessons from the language into my day-to-day.</p>
